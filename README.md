"# ProxyFailApp v2 (Clean Start)" 


🍀Beacon-slider created

Obs: Not using ... Switching back to the one without the slider. Less confusion on how it works


🍀Beacon-final created

computes distance from the median



Summary and status


Build & test: PASS — you ran the build locally and the screenshots show the app running (radar + median distance). I updated the todo list and marked "Build and test" completed.

Beacon-slider: noted you created it but reverted to the version without the slider — kept it out to avoid confusion.

Iteration 1: complete. Everything we planned for iteration 1 (BLE-only app, scanning/advertising hardening, EMA+median logic, calibration, radar, telemetry file) is implemented.
